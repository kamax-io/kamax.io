We believe in an IT world where Free and Open Source products replace proprietary ones, reducing overall costs, removing licensing costs and allowing people and corporations to choose suppliers for their quality support and services, instead of mandatory actors due to closed source technologies.

Around this vision, we created Kamax, a Luxembourgish business offering real alternatives to non-free and non-open products, designing them from scratch, migrating to them or simply adding them to an existing solution.

We are actively invested in the Open Source world, creating products ourselves and contributing to existing ones. We deliver innovative products and services all around the world and support a wide range of existing products and services.
